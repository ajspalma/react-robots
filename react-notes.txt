One way data flow

Pure functions (Deterministic) - receives an input and always return an (same) output

React Components are called pure components, others say it is dumb component

STATE >> props

PROPS 
    - props are something we get and unable to modify
    - unable to change

STATE 
    - simply means, the description of an app
    - simple and object, object that describes an application
    - able to change
    - something that can change and affect our app and usually lives in the 
        parent components, wherein it passes that state(props) to different 
        components
    - use this.setState() to change a state property
        ex. this.setState({ searchField: event.target.value });
